# RSA-encryption

RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private. <br>

An example of asymmetric cryptography :

1.A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.<br>
2.The server encrypts the data using clientâ€™s public key and sends the encrypted data. <br>
3.Client receives this data and decrypts it.

# Instructions to run the code
* To understand the basic working of the algorithm compile program sender.cpp by executing the following:
1. g++ sender.cpp
2. ./a.out <br>
* Follow the interactive instruction given on the terminal to proceed further and get the result.
copy the encrypted message from the terminal
